## Overview of Project

Below is a brief analysis of how theater campaigns fared with their periodic launch dates and outcomes based on goals in the Kickstarter campaign. The first part of the analysis is based on each campaign’s outcome which is divided into three categories successful, failed, and canceled. While the second analysis takes a closer look at campaign outcomes based on goals.

### Purpose

This analysis aims to visualize campaign outcomes to determine the performance of various campaigns within a specific period and outcomes based on goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

The line graph above shows the outcome based on the launch dates for the theatre. This was achieved using a pivot table from which a line graph is used to create a visual representation.

The Y-axis represents the number of campaigns while the X-axis represents the months in which these campaigns were launched and their subsequent outcomes.

The above line graph is a visual representation of dollar-amount ranges showing the outcome based on goals within the “successful”, “failed” and “canceled” category in percentages.

The Y-axis represents the percentage achieved compared to the goal while the X-axis shows the dollar-amount ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The data set appears to be inconsistent when filter on a yearly basis as lots of months are without any data set. The data set only seems to make sense when all the years are ticked on the yearly filtered button. Consequently, it is impossible to provide an accurate analysis on different years’ month to month basis.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Looking at the line chart for “theater outcomes based on launch date”, the line for successful campaigns experienced an upward steady growth from March to May, May being the peak of successful campaigns, after which successful campaign diminishes throughout the rest of the months.

However, it is also noted that the month of May has the highest number of campaign (166), as well as has the highest successful (111) and failed campaign (52).  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The most successful range (1000-4999) as represented in the graph shows a 76 percent success rate of campaign goals reached. Based on the overall look of the data and line graph, it can be deduced that the larger the amount, the harder it is to achieve campaign goals.
